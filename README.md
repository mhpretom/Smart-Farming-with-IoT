# Smart-Farming-with-IoT
This project proposes a shrewd cultivating framework with the assistance of (Internet of Things) IoT technology. The framework will provide constant information on a specific homestead by utilizing IoT sensors. The principle point of IoT is to give ongoing information like temperature, humidity, soil dampness of any ranch. As per this information, a motor will be controlled automatically to inundate the farm. It has legitimate exactness and accuracy as it utilizes IoT technology, which gives exact perusing utilizing specific sensors. An Arduino miniature regulator (micro-controller) is utilized, which utilizes less power and give a reasonable handling rate to the IoT module. The primary aftereffect of the paper is to control the water system of a ranch as per temperature, moisture and humidity. So, the yields do not flood with water or get less water.
